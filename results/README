The contents of this folder allow to recreate all graphs used in my thesis. Most
data was acquired using the various scripts in ../launch, and then transformed
into the CSV data sets using LibreOffice Calc. Comparative data from OpenCL
benchmarks running on NVIDIA graphics cards was generated using the CLaxon
OpenCL benchmark repository, which can be found on:
